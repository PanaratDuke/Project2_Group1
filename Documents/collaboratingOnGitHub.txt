If you don't want to watch VDO here is short version

git clone my repo into your local

git pull origin master (to make sure that you got latest update)

git checkout -b new_branch_name (create new branch for you to add into repo)

add or remove files in your local repo then

git add .

git commit -m "comment what you did with those file"

git push origin new_branch_name

then slack me to merge your new_brance_name to origin master
